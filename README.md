# Social-Media-Project

We were focusing more on conversion.
We had 3 campaigns, and we found that the Fall campaign was the one that brought us the most conversions.
This could be due to the marketing message, the product itself, the price, or the advertising style, which might have been more creative than the other campaigns.

So we can create a survey through which we can know the reason, to improve and attract more customers.
Also, during the Fall campaign, Pinterest brought more conversions than the other campaigns.

It also shows that the month with the highest conversions was not the month with the highest CTR.
This means in another month, people clicked more but didn’t purchase — maybe the product price was higher at that time, or the user journey wasn’t that easy.

It also shows analysis for each platform separately,
It tells me what the reach was on each.
It also shows the month with the highest conversions compared to CTR, so we can know if the ad was attractive or not,
and whether there’s an issue in the user interface,
which we can use to increase conversion.
